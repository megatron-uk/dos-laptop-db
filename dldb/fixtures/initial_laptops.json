      "notes": "The Sound Blaster 1.0 (code named \"Killer Kard\"), CT1320A, was released in 1989. In addition to Game Blaster features, it has a 9-voice (11 voices in drum mode) FM synthesizer using the Yamaha YM3812 chip, also known as OPL2. It provided compatibility with the market leader AdLib sound card, which had gained support in PC games in the preceding year. Creative used the \"DSP\" acronym to designate the digital audio part of the Sound Blaster. This stood for Digital Sound Processor, rather than the more common digital signal processor, and is a simple microcontroller from the Intel MCS-51 family (supplied by Intel and Matra MHS, among others). It can play back 8-bit monaural sampled sound at up to 23 kHz sampling frequency and record 8-bit at up to 12 kHz. The sole DSP-like features of the circuit are ADPCM decompression and a primitive non-MPU-401-compatible MIDI interface. The ADPCM decompression schemes supported are 2 to 1, 3 to 1 and 4 to 1. The CT1320B variety of the Sound Blaster 1.0 typically has C/MS chips installed in sockets rather than soldered on the PCB, though units do exist with the C/MS chips soldered on.\r\n\r\nSome sources note that the original Sound Blaster 1.0 was produced under the CT1310 number. This however is a topic of ongoing debate. Creative refers to CT1310 for the Sound Blaster 1.0 on its website.\r\n\r\nIn less than a year, the Sound Blaster became the top-selling expansion card for the PC. It achieved this by providing an AdLib-compatible product, with additional features, for the same, and often lower, price. The inclusion of a game port was important to its early success. PCs of this era did not include a game port. Game port cards were costly (around US$50) and used one of the few expansion slots PCs had at the time. Given the choice between an AdLib card or a fully-compatible Sound Blaster card that came with a game port, saved a slot, and included the \"DSP\" for not much more in price, many consumers opted for the Sound Blaster. In-game support for the digital portion of the card did not happen until after the Sound Blaster had gained dominance.\r\n\r\nWhen Microsoft announced Multimedia PC (MPC) in November 1990, it suggested to developers that they use the Sound Blaster as it was the only sound card that came close to complying with the MPC standard. The press speculated that Microsoft based the MPC standard on the Sound Blaster's specifications. By 1993 Computer Gaming World wondered \"why would a gamer\" buy a competing AdLib card that was not Sound Blaster-compatible. Creative advertised the Sound Blaster 16 (\"the 16-bit sound standard\") with the slogan \"Get Real\", emphasizing its \"real 100% Sound Blaster compatibility\" and rhetorically asking \"why those other manufacturers spend so much time comparing themselves to Sound Blaster\".\r\n\r\n(Taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_Blaster)\r\n\r\n=====\r\n\r\nSound Blaster 1.5\r\n\r\nThe Sound Blaster 1.5 is a slight variation which dropped support for two optional CMS music chips which made the earlier 1.0 model compatible with the earlier Creative Game Blaster. Most games do not support this and it is of no relevance to digital audio support.\r\n\r\nSound Blaster 2.0\r\n\r\nThe Sound Blaster 2.0 added some supporting features which allowed for double buffered DMA audio output.\r\n\r\nMost DOS games which support digital audio output will support either/both the Soundblaster 1.0/2.0. This means, in reality:\r\n\r\n- 8bit digital audio\r\n- Mono\r\n- Up to 22KHz sampling\r\n\r\nHaving Sound Blaster 1.0 support is the absolute lowest common denominator for any DOS game which wants digital audio output.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this database, SB 1.0/2.0 support refers only to the digital audio portion."

The Sound Blaster Pro was fully backward compatible with the original Sound Blaster line, and by extension, the AdLib sound card. \r\n\r\nThe Sound Blaster Pro was the first Creative sound card to have a built-in CD-ROM interface. Most Sound Blaster Pro cards featured a proprietary interface for a Panasonic (Matsushita MKE) drive. \r\n\r\nThe Sound Blaster Pro cards are basically 8-bit ISA cards, they use only the lower 8 data bits of the ISA bus. While at first glance it appears to be a 16-bit ISA card, it does not have 'fingers' for data transfer on the higher \"AT\" portion of the bus connector. It uses the 16-bit extension to the ISA bus to provide the user with an additional choice for an IRQ (10) and DMA (0)m channel only found on the 16-bit portion of the edge connector.\r\n\r\n(Taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_Blaster)\r\n\r\n=====\r\n\r\nSound Blaster Pro (2.0)\r\n\r\nThe revised version, the Sound Blaster Pro 2, Model CT1600, replaced the YM3812s with a more advanced Yamaha YMF262 (OPL3). Otherwise it is functionally identical to the original Sound Blaster Pro. \r\n\r\n(Taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_Blaster)\r\n\r\n=====\r\n\r\nThe Sound Blaster Pro models offered a step-up from the original Sound Blaster 1.0 / 2.0 by providing:\r\n\r\n- Stereo 8bit digital audio\r\n- Up to 22KHz stereo recording or 44KHz mono\r\n- TWO Yamaha OPL2 chips offering stereo FM (Pro 1.0)\r\n- OR a single Yamaha OPL3 chip (Pro 2.0)\r\n\r\nNote that support for dual OPL2 stereo was short-lived, as most manufacturers moved to the OPL3 (offering stereo in one package), so the amount of games with dual OPL2 stereo music is limited. Whilst the OPL3 is backwards compatible with the OPL2, it is -not- backwards compatible with -dual- OPL2 chips; rendering any dual OPL2 soundtrack in mono.\r\n\r\nWhen most games refer to Sound Blaster Pro it can usually be assumed that they are referring to digital stereo sample playback (e.g. a gunshot from Doom in the left or right speaker), unless it specifically refers to dual-OPL2 music.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this database, SB Pro 1.0/2.0 support refers only to the digital audio portion."

It offered similar features to the AWE32, but also had a few notable improvements, including support for greater polyphony, although this was a product of 32 extra software-emulated channels (the additional channels could also be obtained on AWE32 hardware by using the AWE64's driver software). The 30-pin SIMM slots from AWE32/SB32 were replaced with a proprietary memory format which could be (expensively) purchased from Creative.\r\n\r\nThe main improvements were better compatibility with older SB models, and an improved signal-to-noise ratio.

Melody polyphony is limited to nine voices in melodic mode and six voices in percussive mode.\r\n\r\nAmong its newly-added features is the ability to pick between four waveforms for each individual oscillator by setting a register. In addition to the original sine wave, three modified waveforms can be produced: half-sine waves (where the negative part of the sine is muted), absolute-sine waves (where the negative part is inverted), and pseudo-sawtooth waves (quarter sine waves upward only with silent sections in between). This odd way of producing waveforms give the YM3812 a characteristic sound. \r\n\r\nThe YM3812 is used with an external YM3014B monophonic DAC chip to output its audio in analog form, like with the YM3526.\r\n\r\nHaving little competition on the market at the time of introduction of Adlib and Sound Blaster in the late 1980s, the chip became the de-facto standard for \"Sound Blaster compatible\" sound cards.\r\n\r\n(Taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_OPL)\r\n\r\n=====\r\n\r\nThe YM3812 (OPL2) chip from Yamaha is a mono FM synth which formed the basis of the Adlib Music Synthesizer and the original Creative Sound Blaster cards.\r\n\r\nSupported in the vast majority of DOS games until Windows finally took over, having support for (at a minimum) OPL2 is an absolute -must- for any gamer wishing to play games natively in DOS with working music (and often, effects, too).\r\n\r\nIt is subject to intense arguments about which OPL2 implementation is superior, but most gamers would agree that having an original Yamaha OPL2 chip is far superior than most of the alternatives (possibly excepting the excellent ESS ESFM implementation of OPL3)."

This makes the YMF262 produce more harmonically richer sound than its predecessors, similar to that of contemporary consumer synthesizer keyboards such as Yamaha DX100.\r\n\r\nThe following features were added:\r\n\r\n- twice as many channels (18 instead of 9)\r\n- simple stereo (hard left, center or hard right)\r\n- 4 channel sound output\r\n- 4 new waveforms (alternating-sine, \"camel\"-sine, square and logarithmic sawtooth)\r\n- 4 operator mode, pairing 2 channels together to create up to six 4 operator FM voices\r\n- reduced latency for host-register access (the OPL2 had much longer I/O access delays)\r\n- subtle differences in the sine-wave lookup table and envelope generator to YM3812 (e.g. the modulator waveform on YM3812 is delayed by one sample, whereas both carrier and modulator waveforms on OPL3 are properly synchronized)[\r\n\r\n(Taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_OPL)\r\n\r\n=====\r\n\r\nThe YMF262 / YMF289 are real Yamaha implementations of the OPL3 design.

      "notes": "ESS Technology Incorporated is a private manufacturer of computer multimedia products, Audio DACs and ADCs based in Fremont, California with R&D centers in Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada and Beijing, China. It was founded by Forrest Mozer in 1983. Robert L. Blair is the CEO and President of the company.\r\n\r\nHistorically, ESS Technology was most famous for their line of their Audiodrive chips for audio cards. Now they are known for their line of Sabre DAC and ADC products.\r\n\r\nElectronic Speech Systems produced synthetic speech for, among other things, home computer systems like the Commodore 64. Within the hardware limitations of that time, ESS used Mozer's technology, in software, to produce realistic-sounding voices that often became the boilerplate for the respective games. Two popular sound bites from the Commodore 64 were \"He slimed me!!\" from Ghostbusters and Elvin Atombender's \"Another visitor. Stay a while—stay forever!\" in the original Impossible Mission.\r\n\r\nAt some point, the company moved from Berkeley to Fremont, California. Around that time, the company was renamed to ESS Technology.\r\n\r\nLater, in 1994, Forrest Mozer's son Todd Mozer, an ESS employee, branched off and started his own company called Sensory Circuits Inc, later Sensory, Inc. to market speech recognition technology.\r\n\r\nIn the mid-1990s, ESS started working on making PC audio, and later, video chips, and created the Audiodrive line, used in hundreds of different products. Audiodrive chips were at least nominally Creative Sound Blaster Pro compatible. Many Audiodrive chips also featured in-house developed, OPL3-compatible FM synthesizers (branded ESFM Synthesizers). These synthesizers were often reasonably faithful to the Yamaha OPL3 chip, which was an important feature for the time as some competing solutions, including Creative's own CQM synthesis featured in later ISA Sound Blaster compatibles, offered sub-par FM sound quality. Some PCI-interface Audiodrives (namely the ES1938 Solo-1) also provided legacy DOS compatibility through Distributed DMA and the SB-Link interface.\r\n\r\nMost recently, ESS SABRE DACs are used in the LG V10 smartphone, with a quad DAC configuration present in the V10's successor LG V20. A slightly upgraded version of the same DAC in the V20, the SABRE ES9218P, is used in the V30 as well as the V40 ThinQ. The ESS9038Pro is their flagship and competes against Japanese AKM (Asahi Kasei Microdevices) AK4499EXEQ and American Cirrus Logic CS43131 for a share of the market. ESS and AKM dominate the desktop audiophile devices including external DACs and integrated all in one DAC/Amp devices. Meanwhile Cirrus Logic dominates the portable device market, Apple Inc is its number one customer accounting for approximately 83% of its chip sales.\r\n\r\nThe luxury Sennheiser HE 1 electrostatic headphone utilizes 8 internal DACs of the SABRE ES9018.\r\n\r\n(Taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESS_Technology)"

They consist of low-cost sound chips providing FM synthesis for use in computing, music and video game applications.\r\n\r\nThe OPL series of chips enabled the creation of affordable sound cards for IBM PC compatibles in the late 1980s such the AdLib and Sound Blaster, effectively becoming a de-facto standard until they were supplanted by \"wavetable synthesis\" cards in the early-to-mid 1990s.\r\n\r\nOPL2 and/or OPL3 audio device functionality are -essential- for any gamer wishing to play games on native DOS. However, non-Yamaha implementations can often leave a lot to be desired...\r\n\r\nYamaha entered the PC audio MIDI scene with their TG100 sound module in 1991. At the time, they were competing directly with Roland's SC-55 Sound Canvas. The TG100 was followed with the TG300 in 1993. The TG-series was followed by the very popular MU-series which introduced Yamaha's superset of General MIDI, called XG.\r\n\r\nTheir OPL3-SA line of ISA-based audio devices proved very popular and the later DS-XG PCI audio chips provided a good blend of functions and features at reasonable prices.\r\n\r\n(Content from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_OPL and https://www.dosdays.co.uk/topics/Manufacturers/yamaha.php)"

      "notes": "Crystal Semiconductor Corporation was an American computer company based in Austin, Texas, and active from 1984 to the early 2000s. Founded by Michael J. Callahan and James H. Clardy, the company originally specialized in the design and manufacture of silicon for mixed-signal integrated circuits, namely digital-to-analog (DAC) and analog-to-digital (ADC) converters. After being acquired by Cirrus Logic of San Jose, California, in 1991 for about $59 million, the company became a dominant player in the personal computer sound chip market.\r\n\r\nThe company exceeded $100 million in sales for the first time in 1991.  In September 1991, Cirrus Logic, Inc., a San Jose, California–based fabless semiconductor company specializing in personal computer chips, announced the acquisition of Crystal in a stock swap worth roughly $59 million at the time. The acquisition was completed in late October 1991, the company becoming an independent subsidiary of Cirrus Logic while retaining its headquarters, name, and marketing team. After the acquisition, Crystal pivoted away from general-purpose converters to modems and sound-generating ASICs for personal computers.[18] Prompted by growing sales and employment, between April and June 1993, the company's 350 workers moved out from their old headquarters to a new plant in Austin four times its size. Around the same time, Cirrus Logic earmarked another 45,000-square-foot plant in the area for them to occupy in January 1994.\r\n\r\nCrystal under Cirrus Logic's ownership employed 429 in 1995. Between 1997 and 1998 the company cut 30 jobs, amid a wave of layoffs at Cirrus Logic affecting between 400 and 500 workers total. Clardy left the company in 1997, citing overbearing management from Cirrus Logic. That year, Crystal launched a lawsuit against Milpitas-based OPTi Inc. and Singapore-based TriTech Microelectronics for alleged patent infringement of Crystal's mixed-signal technology. The courts ruled in favor of Crystal in late 1999 or early 2000, ordering TriTech and OPTi to pay their portion of a combined $20 million.\r\n\r\nIn April 2000, Cirrus Logic relocated their headquarters and management from San Jose to Crystal's home of Austin, citing a pivot away from video controller chips to Crystal's specialty of audio and optical storage controller chips. By 2002, Cirrus Logic had absorbed Crystal into their base of operations and finally retired the name.\r\n\r\n(Taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Semiconductor)"

      "notes": "The Maestro-1™ PCI audio accelerator is part of ESS Technology’s new generation of architecture that not only meets the demands of advanced PC audio applications, but also enables the integration of a complete multimedia subsystem on either a single adapter or motherboard. \r\n\r\nMaestro-1’s functionality and interfaces are compliant with all major industry standards, including the Audio Subsystem Specification of PC97, Windows® 95 DirectSound™, Windows® Sound System® , AC’97 CODEC Interface, and PCI 2.1 Bus Specification.\r\n\r\nThe dual audio-engine Maestro-1 architecture consists of a 64-voice, pipelined, wavetable synthesizer and a proprietary programmable audio signal processor. Together they can simultaneously and efficiently handle multiple audio streams of different data types, high-quality music synthesis, and voice compression and decompression.\r\n\r\nThe Maestro-1 provides a high-performance PCI interface, while retaining full compatibility to existing DOS games through hardware emulation. The PCI bus is required for PC audio hardware to smoothly reproduce high-fidelity audio from Internet, MIDI, wave, and conferencing sources. The PCI bus achieves high-performance functionality by enabling the transfer of multiple, independent data streams. PCI improves data transfer efficiency by at least 20 times over the ISA bus. This is crucial for low-latency audio applications, such as Internet interactive audio.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft's DirectSound API is accelerated by digitally mixing up to 32 PCM streams of any frequency down to a single output stream of 48 kHz. Hardware acceleration frees the CPU to perform other tasks, such as video processing.\r\n\r\nThe Maestro-1’s Wave Processor (WP) provides high-quality wavetable synthesis cost-effectively by storing the downloadable table samples in system memory. With ESS’s WaveCache™ technology, the samples are retrieved using the PCI bus during playback. Each channel/stream has an independent pan, tremolo, vibrato and tone filter. The synthesizer also performs advanced audio effects such as reverb, chorus, flange, echo and 3-D spatial enhancement.\r\n\r\nThe Maestro-1 achieves complete DOS game compatibility through three major schemes: PC/PCI DMA, Distributed DMA, and Transparent DMA. Transparent DMA requires no sideband signals and is compatible with all Pentium® and Pentium Pro® chipsets with no constraints.\r\n\r\n(From the ESS Maestro-1 datasheet pdf)\r\n\r\n=====\r\n\r\nMIDI support is only available within Windows.\r\n\r\nNote that the datasheet makes no mention of the previous ESS ESFM FM synthesis technology - this is because it has been removed from the Maestro and subsequent ESS devices. FM performance with the Maestro-1 is significantly inferior to previous ESS audio devices."

These features include a 64-voice wavetable synthesizer with Downloadable Sample (DLS) and complete DirectSound™ support. \r\n\r\nThe Maestro-2 proprietary technology supports both Microsoft®’s PC97 logo requirements and DOS game compatibility.\r\n\r\nThe Maestro-2 device works with any AC’97 compliant CODEC including ESS Technology’s own PT-101 AC’97-link CODEC. A secondary AC’97 CODEC interface supports an additional CODEC. Support for a Dumbar™ bridge docking solution for the secondary CODEC interface is planned for Q4 of 1997. The Maestro-2 communicates with a Dumbar bridge through a “super AC-link”. This link carries both PCM audio data and data for nonCODEC related data; i.e. game port, MPU-401, GPI/O, etc.\r\n\r\nThe dual audio-engine Maestro-2 architecture consists of a 64-voice, pipelined, wavetable synthesizer and a proprietary audio signal processor.

The data is retrieved using high-performance PCI bus cycles during playback or recording.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft's DirectSound API is accelerated by digitally mixing up to 32 PCM streams of any frequency down to a single output stream of 48 kHz. This \"final\" buffer can then be piped to any CODEC (through the two attached AC'97 IF, 1394, USB) available to the system. This acceleration frees up the CPU to perform other tasks.\r\n\r\nThe Maestro-2 audio accelerator supports a number of different legacy audio schemes, including Distributed DMA protocol, PC/PCI DMA, Compaq® style one-signal SERIRQ#, and Transparent DMA. This ensures complete DOS game compatibility.\r\n\r\nThe Maestro-2 power management complies with both Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) 1.0 and Advanced Power Management (APM) rev. 1.2.\r\n\r\n(From the ESS Maestro-2 datasheet pdf)\r\n\r\n=====\r\n\r\nMIDI support is only available within Windows.\r\n\r\nNote that the datasheet makes no mention of the previous ESS ESFM FM synthesis technology - this is because it has been removed from the Maestro and subsequent ESS devices.

It uses the highbandwidth PCI bus to deliver advanced PC audio features, such as HRTF 3D positional audio, DirectSound acceleration and DVD AC-3 5.1 to 2 speaker virtualization.\r\n\r\nThe ES1980 implements multistream DirectSound and DirectSound3D acceleration with digital mixing, sample rate conversion, and HRTF 3D filtering. The ES1980 maintains full DOS legacy audio compatibility over the standard PCI 2.1 and PCI 2.2 buses. The ES1980 is designed for high-performance consumer multimedia notebook PC applications.\r\n\r\nThe ES1980 includes a programmable audio signal processor and provides simultaneous support for multiple audio streams.\r\n\r\nWith its built-in DSP core, the ES1980 uses its dedicated direct memory access (DMA) engine to handle complex signal processing tasks with a bus-mastering PCI interface.\r\n\r\nThe support functions ensure efficient transfer of audio data streams to and from system memory buffers, providing a system solution with maximum performance and minimal host CPU loading. The architecture enables implementation of communications over the Internet from multiple sources. The ES1980 incorporates an HSP modem interface via its ACLink connecting with the ES2828 MC‘97 codec. The MC‘97 is used as the analog front end for the modem and DAA control.\r\n\r\nThe V.90 modem runs on the host while the ES1980 serves as the bidirectional buffer for data transmission and reception. The modem functions include the standard AT command set, V.42bis and Group 3 fax.\r\n\r\nThe ES1980, which operates at 3.3V digitally, is compliant with the Advanced Power Management (APM) 1.2, Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) 1.1, and PCI Power\r\nManagement Interface (PPMI) 1.1. The ES1980 supports D0, D1, D2, and D3 power-saving modes for power efficiency when the audio system is both active and idle.\r\n\r\nThe ES1980 provides a high-quality docking solution and supports an AC-link based digital docking solution with its secondary AC‘97 Extension 2.1 compliant interface. CLKRUN#\r\npin support can be used to stop the PCI interface clock. This helps achieve the lowest power consumption in D3hot state.\r\n\r\nThe ES1980 provides full DOS game compatibility through three hardware implementations: PC/PCI, distributed DMA (DDMA), and transparent DMA (TDMA). \r\n\r\n(Taken from the ESS Maestro-3 datasheet pdf)\r\n\r\n=====\r\n\r\nMIDI support is only available within Windows.\r\n\r\nNote that the datasheet makes no mention of the previous ESS ESFM FM synthesis technology - this is because it has been removed from the Maestro and subsequent ESS devices.

      "notes": "Intel, now currently embedded in the Chipset Industry, decided to make another giant leap with the final addition to the Socket-7 line of chipsets, originally thought of as being called the Triton IV chipset and boasting features not even found in the HX chipset the TX chipset turned out to be a bit of a disappointment for most users, although not all.\r\n\r\nThe TX Chipset was intended to be the first and last Socket-7 chipset to be able to boast high end features such as SDRAM and USB support while allowing the user a variety of power saving options to use. The highly integrated 2 chip packaging solution found in the TX chipset is superior even to that of the 430HX chipset, one of the few areas in which the TX chipset is actually superior to the HX.\r\n\r\nThe SDRAM performance of the TX chipset isn't \"bone shattering\" due to a timing problem with the chipset (which has been corrected in the Pentium II successor to the TX chipset, the LX chipset), however the stability of SDRAM and the TX chipset at higher bus speeds is much greater than that of EDO and the HX Chipset.\r\n\r\nThe UltraDMA specification is another plus of the TX chipset, with theoretical transfer rates as high as 33MB/S, nearly equivalent to UltraWide SCSI-3 performance although that number cannot be reproduced significantly in real world applications. Unfortunately the TX chipset still doesn't have the deep CPU and PCI buffers found in the HX chipset, however the performance difference between the TX and the HX chipsets is barely noticeable. \r\n\r\nThe 256MB maximum memory limit of the TX chipset is blurred by its meager 64MB cacheable memory area which takes us back to the old days of the FX chipset. Intel made the TX chipset the proper fare well to the Socket-7 standard in order to make way for the new Slot-1 motherboards, however what they failed to realize was that by not giving the user the option of AGP in a Socket-7 motherboard other companies such as VIA are able to step up and satisfy this need.\r\n\r\n(Taken from https://dosdays.co.uk/topics/intel_chipsets.php)"

      "name": "Intel 440BX",
      "notes": "The Intel 440BX is the third Pentium II chipset released by Intel, succeeding the 440FX and 440LX. With the new 100 MHz front side bus, Pentium II CPUs were able to scale better in performance by reducing the difference between processor clock and bus speed. The previous 66 MHz bus had become a serious bottleneck and dated back to the first Pentium \"Classic\" chipsets.\r\n\r\nThe 440BX had two closely related chipset peers; the 440ZX and 440MX. 440MX is a mobile chipset for laptops, although a number of notebooks did use 440BX. 440ZX is a cost-reduced version of 440BX. It has a lower maximum RAM limit resulting from having support for only 2 RAM banks. The 440ZX-66, designed for Intel Celeron processors, is limited to 66 MHz FSB speed.\r\n\r\nThe 440BX became one of Intel's most popular chipsets. Enthusiasts enjoyed its overclockability, with the chipset capable of running the front-side bus at speeds ranging from 66 MHz to well over 133 MHz, in stark contrast to the 440LX's struggle to top 75 MHz. A common overclock involved the pin-40 hack, or using an ABIT BP6 or Asus P2B, and setting the bus speed on a 66 MHz Covington or Mendocino-core Celeron to 100 MHz. The Mendocino-core Celeron 300A became a \"sweet spot\" for overclockers, with nearly 100% success rates at reaching 450 MHz on a 100 MHz FSB, allowing it to equate to a much more expensive Pentium II at 450 MHz. Other popular overclocks included the SL2W8-stepping Deschutes-core Pentium II that could often run to 450 MHz at 100 MHz FSB, and the SL35D Katmai-core Pentium III 450 MHz which could frequently manage 600 MHz on a 133 MHz FSB. The later Pentium III Coppermine-core processor was easily overclocked and performed well on 440BX motherboards. Finally, the unsupported Tualatin-core Pentium III could be used with an adapter and various modifications, with varying degrees of success.\r\n\r\nIronically, the 440BX offered better performance than several of its successors. The i810 and i820 chipsets were unable to beat the 440BX at the 100 MHz FSB speed. The i820 was plagued with a requirement for high cost RDRAM to reach good performance, along with a string of reliability issues involving an RDRAM-to-SDRAM memory translator hub in designs using that chipset with SDRAM. Unofficially, the 440BX could often be taken to 133 MHz FSB. Enthusiast motherboards, such as the Asus P3B-F and Abit BH6/BF6/BE6 series, were equipped with BIOS options to set the board to this unofficial speed. With a 133 MHz FSB, the 440BX could even match the later i815 chipset, which was designed to accommodate the final Tualatin-core Pentium III.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, running a 440BX above 100 MHz FSB resulted in the AGP video card being forced to run on an overclocked AGP bus, as the 440BX only had \"2/3\" and \"1/1\" bus dividers. Some video cards were tolerant of this, such as various early NVIDIA GeForce cards, but more than a few were unstable with a 35% AGP overclock. The PCI bus was not affected by this problem (there was a \"1/4\" bus divider for the PCI bus on the 440BX) so users could use a PCI graphics card in lieu of an AGP one. However, this inflicted a performance penalty on graphical performance since PCI has significantly lower bandwidth throughput than AGP.\r\n\r\nStill, the later i815 was considered the best Pentium III chipset because it offered a better feature set and very similar performance relative to the 440BX. Not only did the i815 support a proper \"1/2\" AGP divider for the 133 MHz FSB clock rate, AGP 4x, and Ultra DMA 100, but the later revisions also directly supported the Tualatin Pentium III; however, the i815 had a RAM limit of 512MB compared to 440BX's 1GB RAM limit.\r\n\r\nThe success of the 440BX chipset has caused various software emulation and virtualization packages to use it as part of their virtual system. VMware and Microsoft Virtual PC present the Intel 440BX chipset virtually to hosted virtual machines, due to its broad compatibility.\r\n\r\n(Taken from the Wikipedia page for the Intel 440BX)"

Pre-production samples of the 386 were released to select developers in 1985, while mass production commenced in 1986. \r\n\r\nThe processor was a significant evolution in the x86 architecture, extending a long line of processors that stretched back to the Intel 8008. The 386 was the central processing unit (CPU) of many workstations and high-end personal computers of the time. The 386 began to fall out of public use starting with the release of the i486 processor in 1989, while in embedded systems the 386 remained in widespread use until Intel finally discontinued it in 2007.\r\n\r\nCompared to its predecessor the Intel 80286, the 80386 added a three-stage instruction pipeline which it brings up to total of 6-stage instruction pipeline, extended the architecture from 16-bits to 32-bits, and added an on-chip memory management unit. This paging translation unit made it much easier to implement operating systems that used virtual memory. It also offered support for register debugging.\r\n\r\nThe 80386 featured three operating modes: real mode, protected mode and virtual mode. The protected mode, which debuted in the 80286, was extended to allow the 386 to address up to 4 GB of memory. With the addition of segmented addressing system, it can expand up to 64 terabytes of virtual memory. The all new virtual 8086 mode (or VM86) made it possible to run one or more real mode programs in a protected environment, although some programs were not compatible.\r\n\r\nThe 32-bit i386 can correctly execute most code intended for the earlier 16-bit processors such as 8086 and 80286 that were ubiquitous in early PCs. As the original implementation of the 32-bit extension of the 80286 architecture, the i386 instruction set, programming model, and binary encodings are still the common denominator for all 32-bit x86 processors, which is termed the i386 architecture, x86, or IA-32, depending on context. \r\n\r\n(Taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I386)"

It offered a large on-chip cache and an integrated floating-point unit. When it was announced, the initial performance was originally published between 15 and 20 VAX MIPS, between 37,000 and 49,000 dhrystones per second, and between 6.1 and 8.2 double-precision megawhetstones per second for both 25 and 33 MHz version.\r\n\r\nA typical 50 MHz i486 executes 41 million instructions per second Dhrystone MIPS and SPEC integer rating of 27.9. It is approximately twice as fast as the i386 or i286 per clock cycle. The i486's improved performance is thanks to its five-stage pipeline with all stages bound to a single cycle. The enhanced FPU unit on the chip was significantly faster than the i387 FPU per cycle. The i387 FPU was a separate, optional math coprocessor installed in a motherboard socket alongside the i386 (but introduced as an internal component as part of the 486DX).\r\n\r\nThe i486 was succeeded by the original Pentium.

The product was officially named IntelDX4, but OEMs continued using the i486 naming convention.\r\n\r\nIntel produced the 486 DX4 with two clock speed steppings: A 75-MHz version (3× 25 MHz multiplier), and a 100-MHz version (3× 33.3 MHz or 2x 50 MHz). Both chips were released in March 1994. A version of IntelDX4 featuring write-back cache was released in October 1994. The original write-through versions of the chip are marked with a laser-embossed “&E,” while the write-back-enabled versions are marked “&EW.” i486 OverDrive editions of IntelDX4 had locked multipliers, and therefore can only run at 3× the external clock speed. The 100-MHz model of the processor had an iCOMP rating of 435, while the 75-MHz processor had a rating of 319. IntelDX4 was an OEM-only product, but the DX4 Overdrive could be purchased at a retail store.\r\n\r\nThe DX4 microprocessor is mostly pin-compatible with the 486, but requires a lower 3.3-V supply. Normal i486DX and DX2 processors use a 5-V supply; plugging a DX4 into an unmodified socket will destroy the processor.

It was sold as Pentium with MMX Technology (usually just called Pentium MMX); although it was based on the P5 core, it featured a new set of 57 \"MMX\" instructions intended to improve performance on multimedia tasks, such as encoding and decoding digital media data. The Pentium MMX line was introduced on October 22, 1996, and released in January 1997.\r\n\r\nThe new instructions worked on new data types: 64-bit packed vectors of either eight 8-bit integers, four 16-bit integers, two 32-bit integers, or one 64-bit integer. So, for example, the PADDUSB (Packed ADD Unsigned Saturated Byte) instruction adds two vectors, each containing eight 8-bit unsigned integers together, elementwise; each addition that would overflow saturates, yielding 255, the maximal unsigned value that can be represented in a byte. \r\n\r\nOther changes to the core include a 6-stage pipeline (vs. 5 on P5) with a return stack (first done on Cyrix 6x86) and better parallelism, an improved instruction decoder, 16KB L1 data cache + 16KB L1 instruction cache with Both 4-way associativity (vs. 8KB L1 Data/instruction with 2-way on P5), 4 write buffers that could now be used by either pipeline (vs. one corresponding to each pipeline on P5) and an improved branch predictor taken from the Pentium Pro, with a 512-entry buffer (vs. 256 on P5).\r\n\r\nIt contained 4.5 million transistors and had an area of 140 mm2. It was fabricated in a 280 nm CMOS process with the same metal pitches as the previous 350 nm BiCMOS process, so Intel described it as \"350 nm\" because of its similar transistor density.[30] The process has four levels of interconnect.\r\n\r\nWhile the P55C remained compatible with Socket 7, the voltage requirements for powering the chip differ from the standard Socket 7 specifications. Most motherboards manufactured for Socket 7 before the establishment of the P55C standard are not compliant with the dual voltage rail required for proper operation of this CPU (2.8 volt core voltage, 3.3 volt input/output (I/O) voltage). Intel addressed the issue with OverDrive upgrade kits that featured an interposer with its own voltage regulation.\r\n\r\n(Taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_(original)#MMX)"

The most notable differences were the addition of the Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) instruction set (to accelerate floating point and parallel calculations), and the introduction of a controversial serial number embedded in the chip during manufacturing.\r\n\r\nEven after the release of the Pentium 4 in late 2000, the Pentium III continued to be produced with new models introduced up until early 2003. They were then discontinued in April 2004 for desktop units and May 2007 for mobile units.\r\n\r\nSimilarly to the Pentium II it superseded, the Pentium III was also accompanied by the Celeron brand for lower-end versions, and the Xeon for high-end (server and workstation) derivatives. \r\n\r\nThe Pentium III was eventually superseded by the Pentium 4, but its Tualatin core also served as the basis for the Pentium M CPUs, which used many ideas from the P6 microarchitecture. Subsequently, it was the Pentium M microarchitecture of Pentium M branded CPUs, and not the NetBurst found in Pentium 4 processors, that formed the basis for Intel's energy-efficient Core microarchitecture of CPUs branded Core 2, Pentium Dual-Core, Celeron (Core), and Xeon.\r\n\r\n(Taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_III)"

      "name": "Intel Pentium 4",
      "notes": "Pentium 4 is a series of single-core CPUs for desktops, laptops and entry-level servers manufactured by Intel. The processors were shipped from November 20, 2000 until August 8, 2008. All Pentium 4 CPUs are based on the NetBurst microarchitecture, the successor to the P6.\r\n\r\nThe Pentium 4 Willamette (180 nm) introduced SSE2, while the Prescott (90 nm) introduced SSE3 and later 64-bit technology. Later versions introduced Hyper-Threading Technology (HTT). The first Pentium 4-branded processor to implement 64-bit was the Prescott (90 nm) (February 2004), but this feature was not enabled. Intel subsequently began selling 64-bit Pentium 4s using the \"E0\" revision of the Prescotts, being sold on the OEM market as the Pentium 4, model F. The E0 revision also adds eXecute Disable (XD) (Intel's name for the NX bit) to Intel 64. Intel's official launch of Intel 64 (under the name EM64T at that time) in mainstream desktop processors was the N0 stepping Prescott-2M.\r\n\r\nIntel also marketed a version of their low-end Celeron processors based on the NetBurst microarchitecture (often referred to as Celeron 4), and a high-end derivative, Xeon, intended for multi-socket servers and workstations. In 2005, the Pentium 4 was complemented by the more advanced dual-core-brands Pentium D and Pentium Extreme Edition, all were succeeded at the top range by the Core 2 brand, while production continued until 2008, with Pentium 4 replaced by Pentium Dual-Core.[\r\n\r\n(Taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_4)"

Celeron-branded processors released from 2009 to 2023 are compatible with IA-32 software. They typically offer less performance per clock speed compared to flagship Intel CPU lines, such as the Pentium or Core brands. They often have less cache or intentionally disabled advanced features, with variable impact on performance.\r\n\r\n(Taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celeron)"
